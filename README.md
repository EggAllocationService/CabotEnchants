# CabotEnchants

An extension for Bukkit 1.20.4 providing some new quests and activites to do.

Made for use on the Cabot server, but you can use this for your own purposes if you want. There's a good number of config options to adjust the difficulty of some quests.

This does require a resource pack, available at [https://objects.cabotmc.dev/dh_4_4.zip](https://objects.cabotmc.dev/dh_4_4.zip). The resource pack supplies some custom models, fonts, and sounds.

Fair warning, that resource pack contains some assets not essential for this plugin as it's a combination of a few resource packs used with other non-public plugins I wrote.
